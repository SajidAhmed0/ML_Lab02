Routes that are visited later than their preferred times will incur a penalty, which raises the total cost. However, the genetic algorithm might still find an efficient route that balances both distance and time constraints.\n",
    "                                                                                      \n",
    "2.After including time constraints, how did the route change? Did the cost increase?\n",
    "Route Change: The algorithm may modify the order of locations to ensure that the locations are visited before their preferred times, which could result in a different route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Increase: The introduction of time penalties likely increases the cost of the optimal route. Routes that violate time constraints will incur additional penalties, increasing the total cost of the solution. You might find that the best route is still efficient in terms of distance, but the total cost will be higher due to time constraints.\n",
    "                                                                                      \n",
    "3. What happens when you increase the number of generations? What happens when you update the mutation rate, or change the size of the population? Briefly explain the observations. \n",
    "Increasing the Number of Generations: Increasing the number of generations gives the algorithm more opportunities to refine the solution. The route might become more optimized as the population evolves over time, and the cost may decrease with more generations. However, if the algorithm already converges to a good solution early, increasing generations too much could lead to diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating the Mutation Rate: Increasing the mutation rate allows for more diversity in the population, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local minima. This could result in more varied solutions and potentially better routes. However, too much mutation might destabilize the algorithm, while too little mutation could cause it to converge too early and miss better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the Population Size: Increasing the population size typically provides more candidate solutions, which can help the algorithm find better solutions by maintaining diversity. However, a larger population requires more computational resources and may slow down the algorithm. A smaller population may result in faster computation but risks finding suboptimal solutions."
